# Some Udacity Projects

## Robotics Nanodegree Term 2 Beta Test
- Adaptive Monte-Carlo Localization
- Robotics Inference

## Intro to Self-Driving Car Review Submission
- Traffic Light Detector

## Rover
- Perception and Mapping: a "search, sample, and return project" with a virtual rover.

## Follow Me
- I used a fully-convolutional neural network to paint all pixels in an image which is part of a person. Two types of persons are identified, the “hero” target person, and everyone else.

## Behavioral Cloning
- Cloning Driving Behavior with Keras and a Videogame-Like Simulator

## Histogram Filter
- Localization using Histogram Filter Algorithm

## Perception PR 2
  - A catkin workspace in ROS where a virtual PR2 Robot with an RGBD camera perceives objects and places them on the appropriate dropbox.

## Point Cloud Recognition
  - A catkin workspace in ROS that capture features of objects and then train a classifier to correctly identify the objects
from a point cloud file.
